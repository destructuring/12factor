<p>The <a href='concurrency.html'>process formation</a> is the array of processes that are used to do the app&#8217;s regular business (such as handling web requests) as it runs. Separately, developers will often wish to do one-off administrative or maintenance tasks for the app, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Running database migrations (e.g. <code>manage.py syncdb</code> in Django, <code>rake db:migrate</code> in Rails).</li>

<li>Running a console (also known as a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-eval-print_loop'>REPL</a> shell) to run arbitrary code or inspect the app&#8217;s models against the live database. Most languages provide a REPL by running the interpreter without any arguments (e.g. <code>python</code> or <code>erl</code>) or in some cases have a separate command (e.g. <code>irb</code> for Ruby, <code>rails console</code> for Rails).</li>

<li>Running one-time scripts committed into the app&#8217;s repo (e.g. <code>php scripts/fix_bad_records.php</code>).</li>
</ul>

<p>One-off admin processes should be run in an identical environment as the regular <a href='processes.html'>long-running processes</a> of the app. They run against a <a href='build-release-run.html'>release</a>, using the same <a href='code.html'>code</a> and <a href='config.html'>config</a> as any process run against that release. Admin code must ship with application code to avoid synchronization issues.</p>

<p>The same <a href='dependencies.html'>dependency isolation</a> techniques should be used on all process types. For example, if the Ruby web process uses the command <code>bundle exec thin start</code>, then a database migration should use <code>bundle exec rake db:migrate</code>. Likewise, a Python program using Virtualenv should use the vendored <code>bin/python</code> for running both the Tornado webserver and any <code>manage.py</code> admin processes.</p>

<p>Twelve-factor strongly favors languages which provide a REPL shell out of the box, and which make it easy to run one-off scripts. In a local deploy, developers invoke one-off admin processes by a direct shell command inside the app&#8217;s checkout directory. In a production deploy, developers can use ssh or other remote command execution mechanism provided by that deploy&#8217;s execution environment to run such a process.</p>
